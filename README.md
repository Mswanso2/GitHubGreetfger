# CSC 241 GitHub Greeter
In this assignment, you will edit a Java class by adding two methods that return greetings. This is intended to give you practice using GitHub and Git commands. Remember to make commits frequently as you make changes!

## Steps

1. Clone the GitHub Repository to your computer
1. Find and open the `GitHubGreeter.java` file in your favorite editor/IDE
1. Add a new method to the class called `welcome` that returns a `String` and accepts one `String` parameter. The returned value should look like this, `Welcome to GitHub, <name parameter>.` Remember to `git commit`!
1. Add another method called `wishes` that takes no parameters and returns a `String` of the form, `Have a great semester in CSC 241!`
1. Run the `main` method in the `Main` class to test your program. Again, make sure to `git commit`!
1. When you are confident that it is working, push your updates to your GitHub repository. GitHub will run a series of tests to confirm the correct operation of the methods. If any tests fail, make the necessary corrections, commit, then push again.
